**GenAIMed Group** is a collaborative group focused on applying generative AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to medicine and life sciences.

Our goal is to bring together researchers to explore generative AI's potential in medical research through online seminars. We discuss these models' **strengths and limitations**, and initiate multicenter studies to test and improve them.

We welcome experts from universities and institutions to join our platform for brainstorming, resource sharing, and discussing best practices of using generative AI in medicine. By collaborating, we hope to advance this technology, create high-quality research, provide assistive tools for professionals, and drive innovation in medicine and life sciences.

[**Join us**](https://drrobinluo.github.io/joinus) as we work together to realize the potential of AI!
