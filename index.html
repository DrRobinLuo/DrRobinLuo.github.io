<p><strong>GenAIMed Group</strong> is a collaborative group focused on applying generative AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to medicine and life sciences.</p>

<p>Our goal is to bring together researchers to explore generative AI's potential in medical research through online seminars. We discuss these models' <strong>strengths and limitations</strong>, and initiate multicenter studies to test and improve them.</p>

<p>We welcome experts from universities and institutions to join our platform for brainstorming, resource sharing, and discussing best practices of using generative AI in medicine. By collaborating, we hope to advance this technology, create high-quality research, provide assistive tools for professionals, and drive innovation in medicine and life sciences.</p>

<p>We are conducting a questionnaire survey on the use of ChatGPT by medical students and doctors in China. We would greatly appreciate your participation in filling out this survey, which should take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Your input is valuable to us and will contribute to our research. Thank you for your time and assistance.</p>
