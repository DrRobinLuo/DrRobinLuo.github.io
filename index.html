<p><strong>GenAIMed Group</strong> is a collaborative group focused on applying generative AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to medicine and life sciences.</p>

<p>Our goal is to bring together researchers to explore generative AI's potential in medical research through online seminars. We discuss these models' <strong>strengths and limitations</strong>, and initiate multicenter studies to test and improve them.</p>

<p>We welcome experts from universities and institutions to join our platform for brainstorming, resource sharing, and discussing best practices of using generative AI in medicine. By collaborating, we hope to advance this technology, create high-quality research, provide assistive tools for professionals, and drive innovation in medicine and life sciences.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce our latest publication, which addresses the urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation framework for generative artificial intelligence (AI) in medical applications. Our multidisciplinary team has developed a robust, 32-item checklist to ensure reliable and consistent evaluation of generative AI in healthcare. This framework, derived from an extensive literature review, guides researchers through critical aspects such as question collection, querying methodologies, and assessment techniques. By providing a standardized approach, our guidelines aim to enhance research quality and support the evolution of generative AI in medicine. For a concise version of the checklist, please refer to Table S in our publication:<a href="assets/pdfs/stager_checklist.pdf">[pdf]</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/imo2.7">[link]</a></p>
